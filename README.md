# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major business challenge in the telecom industry. This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn patterns** using **pure SQL** to derive meaningful business insights that can help improve customer retention.

The analysis is performed using a real-world telecom dataset containing **7,043 customer records**, covering customer demographics, services used, billing information, and customer status.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used end-to-end for data exploration and analysis without relying on any external tools.
